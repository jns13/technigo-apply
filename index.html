    <h2>Code review</h2>
    <p>Code Review, also known as Peer Code Review, is the act of consciously and systematically convening with one’s fellow programmers to check each other’s code for mistakes and has been repeatedly shown to accelerate and streamline the process of software development like few other practices can. There are peer code review tools and software, but the concept itself is important to understand. Software is written by human beings. Software is therefore often riddled with mistakes. To err is, of course, human, so this is an obvious correlation. But what isn’t so obvious is why software developers often rely on manual or automated testing to vet their code to the neglect of that other great gift of human nature: the ability to see and correct mistakes ourselves.
